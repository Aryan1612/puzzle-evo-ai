# Evolutionary Program Synthesis for Educational Puzzles

Project landing page for the proposal by Aryan Arora (IIT Kharagpur).

## Files in this repo
- `index.html` — project landing page (dark academic theme).
- `style.css` — site styles.
- `assets/paper.pdf` — proposal PDF (place your `aryan_indiaAI_proposal.pdf` here and rename to `paper.pdf`).
- `README.md` — this file.

## Deploying on GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g. `puzzle-evo-ai`) and push these files to `main` branch.
2. Create folder `assets/` and place the proposal PDF as `assets/paper.pdf`.
3. On GitHub: **Settings → Pages** → Source: `main` branch / `/ (root)` → Save.
4. After a minute the site will be available at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Notes
- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` in `index.html` with actual GitHub repo links if you want the "Project repo" link to be accurate.
- To add a demo later, create `demo/` and link it from the hero / platform section.
- Licensed for display and sharing. You can add a LICENSE (MIT/Apache) if desired.
